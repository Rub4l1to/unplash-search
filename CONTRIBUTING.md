# Contributing to unplash-search

Bug reports and code and documentation patches are welcome. You can also help this project by using the development version of Crytocurrency and reporting any bugs you find.

## 1. Reporting bugs

**`It's important` for me that you provide the full context about the bug creating a new comments.**

## 2. Contributing Code and Docs

Before working on a new feature or a bug, please browse [existing issues](https://github.com/Rub4l1to/unplash-search/issues)
to see whether it has previously been discussed.

If your change alters unplash-search behaviour or interface, it's a good idea to discuss it before you start working on it.

If you are fixing an issue, the first step should be to create a test case that reproduces the incorrect behaviour. That will also help you to build an understanding of the issue at hand.

**Pull requests introducing code changes without tests
will generally not get merged. The same goes for PRs changing HTTPieâ€™s behaviour and not providing documentation.**

Conversely, PRs consisting of documentation improvements or tests for existing-yet-previously-untested behavior will very likely be merged. Therefore, docs and tests improvements are a great candidate for your first contribution.

Consider also adding a [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/Rub4l1to/unplash-search/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) entry for your changes.
